This repository is for the edX Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp affiliated with Case Western Reserve University. The assignment in this repo is meant to test skills from module 14 - javascript visualizations. 

I worked on this assignment with the help of edX tutor Kelli Kennedy and using code we learned in class.

Using the provided index.html file, I created visualizations using javascript. The code creating these visualizations is in the file app.js in the js folder inside of the static folder. I created multiple functions in order to update the visualizations based on user input from a dropdown menu. One of the functions creates a horizontal bar chart along with a bubble chart (maddieCharts()). Another function displays demographic metadata on a panel (maddiePanel()). The third function allows the two functions to change with user input (optionChanged()). The final function is to initialize these visualizations depending on the user selection (init()). 

The data was pulled from the url: https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json. This data is available in the file samples.json in the data folder as a reference.
